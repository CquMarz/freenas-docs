Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Separate Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each rack rail includes an inner cabinet rail that must be removed.
Extend the cabinet rail until the white release tab is exposed.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_rail_separate.png
   :width: 100%


Press the white release tab to the right while pulling the cabinet
rail to remove it. Repeat this process for the second rail.


Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on each side of the system. Align the
cabinet rail keyholes with the posts on the side of the chassis. Slide
the rail toward the rear of the system until the metal tab clicks and
secures the rail in place. Repeat this process on the other side.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinetrails.png
   :width: 100%


Mount Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install four cage nuts in the rack, two where the rails attach to the
front of the rack, and two at the rear. Be sure each cage nut is aligned
with the others, front to back and left to right.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_attach_cage_nuts.png
   :width: 70%


Place the rail in the rack with the front end toward the front of the
rack and rear toward the back of the rack. Align the pins on both rail
ends with the mounting holes in the rack. Make sure the attached cage
nuts are lined up with the rail holes. Push the pins into the rack holes
until they lock in place. Use the provided screws to secure the rails to
the cage nuts.

   :width: 100%


Mount Unit in the Rack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Slide the front rack rail forward to meet the rear of the cabinet
rails. Align the cabinet rail with the inside of the front rack rail
and slide the cabinet rail forward until it is fully seated inside the
rack rail. Repeat the process for the second rail.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinet_mount.png
   :width: 40%


When both cabinet rails are secured inside the rack rails, carefully
slide the chassis until the ears are flush with the front of the rack.
Tighten both blue screws on the ears of the chassis to secure the unit
in the rack.

Drive Tray Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Do not install the drives until the chassis has been installed in
the rack.**


Remove Top Cover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Slide the unit out on the rails. Turn the blue screws counterclockwise
to unlock the top cover. Slide the top cover toward the front of the
system, then lift to remove it.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_remove_cover.png
   :width: 75%


Install Drive Trays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array.

A standard drive tray installation order simplifies support and is
strongly recommended:

* SSD drives for SLOG, if present

* SSD drives for L2ARC, if present

* Hard drives or SSD drives for data storage

Install the first drive tray in the front left drive bay. Install the
next drive tray to the right of the first. Install remaining drive
trays to the right across the row. After a row is filled with drives,
move back to the next row and start again with the left bay. A label
on the front left of the lid identifies the preferred order of drive
connection.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Lower the drive tray into a
drive bay until the latch begins to move into place. Push the latch
the rest of the way until it locks into place.

ES60 Cable Management Arm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included cable management arm (CMA) is not required for operation.
If desired, the CMA can be used to help organize the ES60 power and
data cables.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_parts.png
   :width: 85%


The tabs along the side of the flex housing can be unclipped from the
top, the bottom, or removed entirely.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_tabs.png
   :width: 20%


Install the Cable Management Arm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Locate the two posts on the left rear side of the ES60. Align the
holes on the CMA chassis bracket with the posts on the chassis. Slide
the cable management arm forward and pull the lever on the latch
upward to lock the bracket into place.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_clip.png
   :width: 85%


Locate the end of the flex housing with exposed pins. Unclip and open
the two tabs closest to the end, allowing the flex housing to compress
enough to fit into the bracket holes. Press the flex housing firmly
into the bracket until the pins seat in the holes.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_chassis_flex.png
   :width: 85%


Remove the two screws already attached to the side of the CMA rail
bracket. Align the screw holes with the holes in the rear of the left
cabinet rail and attach the bracket to the rail with the screws.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_bracket_rail.png
   :width: 40%


Locate the end of the flex housing with exposed holes. Unclip and open
the two tabs closest to the end, allowing the flex housing to expand
enough to fit over the bracket pins. Press the flex housing firmly
into the bracket until the holes seat on the pins.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_rail_flex.png
   :width: 85%


Completed Cable Management Arm assembly:


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_complete.png
   :width: 80%


Power and data cables are routed through the flex housing. The tabs
can be opened or removed to allow access or space for cable ends.
Leave some slack in the cables at both ends to allow for movement of
the arm and chassis.


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.** Connect a
power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into the
plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat the
process for the second power supply and cord. Plug both power cords
into a outlets. This turns on the ES60. **Wait two minutes for the
drives to start.**


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_powerclip.png
   :width: 25%


**Service and management ports are not used during normal operation.
Do not connect anything to them.**

If the %brand% system is already in operation, the expansion shelf
can be powered on at any time.


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The %brand% system can remain on while the expansion shelf is
connected.

The ES60 is compatible with several %brand% systems. Typical SAS cable
connections for one or two ES60 expansion shelves to %brand% High
Availability (HA) systems are shown here. When a %brand% unit with
only a single storage controller is used, only cables #1 and #3 are
connected.


**X-Series**

The X20 supports a single ES60 expansion shelf. The ES60 must be
connected to the first SAS ports (cables #1 and #2). An additional
ES12 or ES24 expansion shelf can be connected to the second SAS ports
with cables #3 and #4.

.. figure:: images/tn_x_sas_wiring.png
   :width: 70%

   \newpage


**M-Series**

The %brand% M-Series support multiple ES60 expansion shelves, which
can be combined with other %brand% expansion shelves.


**M40**

The SAS cables connect to the *1* ports on the ES60 expansion shelves.


.. _es60_sas_connections:

* Connect cable #1 to the first ES60, expansion controller 1 SAS 1
  port.

* Connect cable #2 to the first ES60, expansion controller 2 SAS 1
  port.

If a second ES60 is present:

* Connect cable #3 to the second ES60, expansion controller 1 SAS 1
  port.

* Connect cable #4 to the second ES60, expansion controller 2 SAS 1
  port.

Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation.

Line up the screw holes on the back of the bezel with the screw holes
on the ears of the ES60. Install one upper screw from the back side of
the left ES60 ear, then install a lower screw from the back of the
right ES60 ear. Install the remaining two screws following the same
diagonal pattern.
